TL;DR DNS should be 1000 times cheaper by now. 
This forces people into big tech and stifles innovation.

### What's the problem?
There are many complaints about the internet. Too many to list here, it only really takes one to need fixing so let's look at one and list the rest later.

#### Your social media friends are not your friends. 
Something people often wish to do is to have lots of friends - to be an influencer. If you had many thousands of followers on a social media site you can only ever reach them on that same social net. 

The first problem with that is that you can be cancelled by the company. This has happened to many people. If your account is suspended then all your followers are gone. Unreachable. If only you had their email addresses or some other way to reach them!

A more likely scenario is that the site will simply raise the 'price' for using it (usually advertisements) and lower the payback for being an influencer. As a company they must try to maximize revenue and this may not be as good for you as it is for them. There's nothing you can do. Cory Doctrow amusingly calls this [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) of the internet (which cracks me up). It's a problem.

### How the web started

The 'internet' started before there were webpages at all. In the beginning the only useful offerings for most were Compuserve and AOL. They were similar to a portal today (like [Yahoo](https://yahoo.com)). The problem with this is that only the company could add pages. Not the people.

The World Wide Web started soon after and anyone with a computer could have a page. This exploded in popularity. It was similar to a social network where content comes from a users computer (there's an app) and not through a big company. Wordpress is popular for that. One could find interesting things by using a search engine (like Google). Collecting followers meant that you got their email addresses. I propose we get back to this ideal.

There was freedom. No company could take away your followers. When or if you made money it was all yours. The search engine could be one of several and competition was possible. At a social media company site (facebook, tiktok, twitter, etc) they decide what to show you and there are no alternatives.

### How the internet works

If we know how it works we can describe how to fix it.

Using the official terms for the internet will bore most people to sleep. It's more fun to explain using magic post offices with lots of P.O. Boxes and tiny magic elves that deliver postcards.

![A wall of post office boxes with a very tiny magic elf](/images/ElfBoxes1.jpeg)

Every computer, and that includes phones has a magic post office with some 65000 P.O. Boxes. You can reserve a box. The post office has an address. It's not like a street address. It's more like a phone number.

For instance: 2398826222 would be such a number. When it's a phone number it looks like this: (239)882-6222  For the internet it's written 142.251.46.238 These are all the same number. If you put this number into a browser:

![google](/images/ip-of-google.png)  
You will get the google homepage because 142.251.46.238 is Googles internet 'address' where google.com is just Googles 'name'.
 
### The elves only deliver Postcards
Example:   
 ![example postcard](/images/Postcard-dns.jpg)

The 'From' address must be the address of the sending computer.   
The elves sometimes lose these postcards and they are readable by anyone along the way. It's better than nothing. 

### For longer messages - Envelope!
Some enterprising elves will take a long message, break it into postcard size pieces, number them, send them and on the other end reassemble them back to the original. If some cards are missing, they will be sent again! This solves the missing postcard problem. There is a fancier version that encrypts everything so nobody can read it.

### Numbers are numbing. 

And everyone hates them. That's why there's '411' for telephones and a phonebook. 
For the internet there's a gadget called DNS. You send it a postcard with a name, like 'google.com' and it sends you back the number, like '142.251.116.113'. Put that number into a browser and see what happens. Like [this](http://142.251.116.113).

### So the way the web works 

is that your computer sends a message with a request for a webpage to Box 80 of some computer. A web page is sent back. Simple. 
In the case of google.com or facebook.com there's a whole warehouse of computers. 
They call the computer supplying the webpage a 'server' but it was really just another computer.

### The problem is

Back in the day every computer could be a 'server'. There was an app for that.
One would simply get a name and then be public. There were blogs, picture brocures
and everything imaginable. This is what made the internet great. 
Over time the ability of *every* computer to be a server slipped away. **This is the problem**.

We could **all** be offering web pages except for 2 things. 

- Our computers/phones don't have permanent global addresses anymore.
- Reserving a name costs tens of dollars per year.

One reason your laptop doesn't have a number address on the internet is because we're running 
low on unused numbers. This is a major problem, however there are workarounds. Follow me on [X/twitter](https://x.com/alan_t_wootton) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/awootton/) and on [substack](https://wootton.substack.com/) for ongoing demos of workarounds.

### And this is how we fix it.

The main problem we propose to fix here is the price of the names. 
There is a demo version of "penny" names at [knotfree.net](https://knotfree.net) running *now*.
It's happening. It's written and it's live. 

The powers that be (ICANN) could make this a reality with the flip of a switch. Let's ask them to please help us.
